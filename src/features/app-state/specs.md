# App State Feature

## Feature Type

This is a core utility feature that manages application-wide state.

## Purpose and Scope

The app-state feature provides a centralized state management system for the application. It maintains the global application configuration and operational state, and provides a controlled interface for accessing and modifying that state.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Provide immutable state structure with read-only properties
- Support retrieving the current application state
- Support updating specific properties of the application state
- Maintain state consistency across the application
- Initialize state at application startup
- Prevent direct mutation of state properties

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Thread safety for concurrent access
- Type safety for all state operations
- Error detection for uninitialized state access

## Technical Design

### Data Structures

- `AppState`: An immutable type with read-only properties representing the application configuration and operational state.

### State Management

- **Global State**: Single instance of AppState maintained in memory
- **Immutability**: All updates create a new state object rather than mutating the existing one
- **Access Control**: State is only accessible through controlled interface functions

### Error Handling

- Check for uninitialized state and throw appropriate errors
- Validate state updates for type consistency

## Dependencies

This feature has minimal dependencies:

- `@shared/mcp-tool/McpTool`: For the McpTool type definition used in the AppState

## Testing Strategy

- Unit test each state management function
- Test error handling for uninitialized state
- Test state updates maintain immutability
- Test concurrent access patterns
